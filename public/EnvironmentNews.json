    "title": "How Can Factories Affect The Environment?",
    "description": "As humans that are exposed to air pollution, water pollution and soil pollution among others, we also face an increased risk of falling victim to illness and disease. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 5% of those diagnosed with lung cancer will be due to extended exposure to pollution.A small percentage of chest infections, lung diseases and heart diseases can also be attributed to pollution according to the WHO.Factories are also a major contributing factor to water pollution across the globe. The illegal dumping of contaminated water, gases, chemicals, heavy metals or radioactive materials into major waterways causes damage to marine life and the environment as a whole. ",

    "title": "What is the importance of trees to the environment?",
    "description": "Trees provide oxygen and limit carbon in the atmosphere. They reduce air pollution, provide food and shelter for wildlife, minimise erosion and maintain healthy soil, increase rainfall, and absorb sunlight as energy. Simply, trees are an essential component of life on Earth.",

    "title": "How does garbage affect the environment?",
    "description": "Poor waste management contributes to climate change and air pollution, and directly affects many ecosystems and species. Landfills, considered the last resort in the waste hierarchy, release methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas linked to climate change.",

    "title": "water pollution for Environment",
    "description": "Water pollutants come from either point sources or dispersed sources. A point source is a pipe or channel, such as those used for discharge from an industrial facility or a city sewerage system. A dispersed (or nonpoint) source is a very broad unconfined area from which a variety of pollutants enter the water body, such as the runoff from an agricultural area. Point sources of water pollution are easier to control than dispersed sources, because the contaminated water has been collected and conveyed to one single point where it can be treated. Pollution from dispersed sources is difficult to control, and, despite much progress in the building of modern sewage-treatment plants, dispersed sources continue to cause a large fraction of water pollution problems.",

    "description": "If plastic waste is worth money, people will pick it up, bring it to the designated recycling center, earning a small amount of money and preventing the plastic from entering our ecosystem.If plastic would be valuable, people would pick it up. Check out how the Plastic Bank is turning plastic waste into Social Plastic to prevent plastic from entering our oceans.To rid the oceans of plastic,we need to not only clean up what is already in the oceans, but we also need to close the tab by stopping new plastic from entering.There is plenty of data on which rivers are the most polluted. We have a great starting point.The Ocean Cleanup works together with government leaders, individuals, and private corporations to tackle the 1000 most polluting rivers all over the world, in five years from rollout.",
