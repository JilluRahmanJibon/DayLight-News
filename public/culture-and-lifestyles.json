    "description": "Traditional clothes may be defined as the collection of garments, jewellery, and accessories rooted in the past worn by an identifiable group of people.Bangladeshi men traditionally wear a kurta, often called Panjabi, on religious and cultural occasions. They may also be seen wearing a shirt unique to Bangladesh called fotua. Fotua is also available in various styles for women. Bangladeshi men wear lungi as casual wear (in rural areas).What we wear is more than just material sewn together to protect us, our clothes are a signifier of our identity and culture. So it's no surprise that over the centuries, communities have used clothing as a means to communicate status, celebrate important events and show unity among many more things.Traditional Indian clothing for women in the north and east are saris worn with choli tops; a long skirt called a lehenga worn with choli and a dupatta scarf to create an ensemble called a ghagra choli; or shalwar kameez suits, while many south Indian women traditionally wear sari and children wear pattu langa.The dress culture of a people is a major distinguishing factor of their culture, as it says a lot about the particular people because the materials used for their clothing accessories and mode of dressing such people is peculiar to them.However, the term 'ethnic wear' is used when speaking about the clothing style of a specific country or region. The term 'traditional clothing' refers to all those clothes that were worn in the past by the ancestors of a particular country or region, but are still being worn by some people in that country. Suggest Corrections.Indian ethnic wear is that part of the Indian culture. Indians are wearing ethnic outfits like ghagra-choli, dhoti-kurta, salwar-suit, kurta-pajama, saree in wedding and some special occasion.",

    "description": "The Argentina national football team has won three FIFA World Cups, one in 1978 and one in 1986, and now in 2022, making them one of the most successful national teams in the world. Only Brazil, Italy, and Germany hold more FIFA World Cup titles than Argentina, who won their third title to surpass France and Uruguay.Progressing into the second half, Argentina looked to secure their lead (and avoid exhausting their players) by slowing down their play—but France soon rallied to a tie with two consecutive goals from Kylian Mbappé, the team’s 23-year-old star player. (Mbappé impressively earned both points within two minutes of each other, causing French fans—among them an effusive Emmanuel Macron—to go wild.)During extra time, Messi scored for Argentina yet again, bringing the score to 3-2, before Mbappé pulled off a hat trick, forcing a tie-breaking shootout at 3-3. While Mbappé and Randal Kolo Muani went on to convert their penalties for France, misses from Kingsley Coman and Aurelien Tchouameni cleared the way for an Argentine win, after Messi, Paulo Dybala, Leandro Paredes, and finally 25-year-old Gonzalo Montiel all found the back of the net, clinching the match. Today’s nerve-racking match follows up yesterday’s equally thrilling third place play-off, in which Croatia defeated Morocco 2-1. It marked the second time Croatia has won third place in the World Cup, having previously finished third back in 1998. Morocco’s fourth-place finish, meanwhile, was still a historic moment, making them the first African nation to reach the World Cup semifinals.More than a million fans gathered in Buenos Aires to celebrate the victory - its first in the World Cup since 1986.Supporters gathered at the city's obelisk, on to which pictures of the players were projected.The crowds grew as night fell with more and more people thronging on to the streets to pay homage to the players.Entire families took to the streets to watch the match unfold, hoisting their children up on their shoulders, so they, too, could get a view of the huge screens which had been erected for the occasion.An explosion of joy ripped through Argentina as its football team won the World Cup. More than a million fans gathered in Buenos Aires to celebrate the victory - its first in the World Cup since 1986. There was no lamppost, traffic light or other vantage point which was not climbed upon by Argentines sporting the blue-and-white shirt of the national team.Across the country, fans said the team's win was even sweeter because of how hard players had had to fight for it. The relief when Gonzalo Montiel scored the crucial penalty in the shoot-out was palpable.Angel Di Maria won a penalty after Ousmane Dembele fouled the winger in the penalty box, which Messi comfortably converted past Hugo Lloris. Di Maria then added a second after slotting the ball home from close range following a brilliant passing move from Argentina which cut Les Bleus apart"

    "description": "Setting Sun, starry night, silvery light of the Moon, snow-covered mountains, deep and dark forests, scent and fragrance of flowers are some of the beauties of Nature. The chirping of birds in trees has a music of its own. In Spring, Nature is at her best. Blooming flowers of different hues fill the air with fragrance.Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity.Nature has been proven, time and time again, to reduce depression, anxiety, stress, and anger, as well as generally boost psychological wellbeing. Nature can help to make you feel happier and more content as a person, which can improve many areas of your life.“Everything in nature invites us constantly to be what we are.” “Every flower is a soul blossoming in nature.” “Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.” In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks. “Nature reduces stress levels,” says Roe. To scientifically prove it, Roe tracked the ability of at-risk populations to access nature and studied how this impacted their stress levels. She correlated socioeconomic and housing data to the proximity of green spaces.Spending time in nature also inspires a sense of awe. This feeling that the world is so much bigger than you can comprehend leads to “expansive thinking,” which allows us to consider different perspectives and can lead to innovative ideas.Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones.Beauteous is the synonym of beautiful that is closest in meaning and form, so is an excellent choice if you want a word that is 'beautiful, but just a little bit different. ' Although it is neither archaic nor obsolete, beauteous is chiefly used in literary contexts, and so will not typically be found in conversation.Natural beauty is one with attractive features and looking attractive naturally without any makeup. It means your lips are beautiful without any lipstick or lip balm, your eyes are beautiful without any kajal or eye makeup, your face is shiny without any compact. Everybody has natural beauty."
